A basic Python game of Rock, Paper, Scissors for two players.  
This was made as a small project to practice **using conditionals**, **user input**, and **while loops** in Python.  **


**##📌How to play**
1. Launch the script in Python (`rock_paper_scissors.py`).
2. Each player enter their selection: **rock, paper, or scissors**.
3. The program selects and declares the winner:
   - Rock beats Scissors  
   - Scissors beats Paper  
   - Paper beats Rock
4. There is a draw if each player select the same choice
5. After every round, players can choose to play again or not again.
